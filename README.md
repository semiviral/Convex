# Convex, an IRC library

 Convex is an IRC library that (tries) to achieve idiomatic simplicty.

 This library targets .NET Standard 2.0

# Implementing the IPlugin interface

 Implementation of the IPlugin interface is fairly simple; use `Core.cs` as a guideline for this.

# Dependencies

 - Databasing: [Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://github.com/aspnet/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite)

 - Config: [Json.Net](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json)

# Ending note

 For questions, or if I've missed anything, feel free to e-mail me at semiviral@gmail.com.

 I will be doing more comprehensive documentation at some point. It may be a while, as the product currently changes often.
